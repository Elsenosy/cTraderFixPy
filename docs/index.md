```

### Usage

```python

from twisted.internet import reactor
from inputimeout import inputimeout, TimeoutOccurred
import json
from ctrader_fix import *

# Callback for receiving all messages
def onMessageReceived(client, responseMessage):
    print("Received: ", responseMessage.getMessage().replace("ï¿½", "|"))
    messageType = responseMessage.getFieldValue(35)
    if messageType == "A":
        print("We are logged in")

# Callback for client disconnection
def disconnected(client, reason): 
    print("Disconnected, reason: ", reason)

# Callback for client connection
def connected(client):
    print("Connected")
    logonRequest = LogonRequest(config)
    send(logonRequest)

# you can use two separate config files for QUOTE and TRADE
with open("config-trade.json") as configFile:
    config = json.load(configFile)

client = Client(config["Host"], config["Port"], ssl = config["SSL"])

# Setting client callbacks
client.setConnectedCallback(connected)
client.setDisconnectedCallback(disconnected)
client.setMessageReceivedCallback(onMessageReceived)
# Starting the client service
client.startService()
reactor.run()

```
